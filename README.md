# com.olabini/clj-utils

A set of small utilities that I find myself rewriting over and over again. In order to use this with leiningen:

```clojure
:dependencies [[com.olabini/clj-utils "0.0.2"]]
```

## com.olabini.sequences

Contains sequence utilities. See the source and function documents for specific uses. Currently these are the functions offered:

* group-into
